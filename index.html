          <h3>Let's learn who cats are</h3>
          <p><span class="first-letter">I</span> am a cat. If you don't know who cats are, go here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" target="_blank">Cats</a> But I really hope you're educated enough. We cats like to play, eat and sleep with our people. It is very important for us to get enough petting every day.</p>	  
	      <p>While you may think your cat is narcoleptic, it�s natural for them to spend a lot of time napping.  The average cat spends roughly 2/3 of its life sleeping. Cats don�t have collarbones � this allows them the flexibility to fit through openings the size of their heads. In North America, there are more cats than dogs.  In fact, according to the Encyclopedia of Cats, over 30% of households own at least one cat. A group of cats is called a clowder. According to Tips for Cats, all kittens are born with blue eyes. According to two psychologists at Queen�s University Belfast, female cats tend to be right-handed, while male cats favor the left. There are 40 recognized breeds of domestic cats in the world.</p>

I remember my sisters, trailer, nanny Linda, and a lot of free time outside. Murkanzas is my motherland and I should always call myself "Arcansas Cat". My dear mamas decided to take me with them to their trip, we spent a lot of time together in the car and different rooms on our way to our new home. I still remember this journey, it was a real fun!</p>
